# Flagz

My first web project.

A two players minesweeper game. Version 0.

 `go get github.com/gorilla/mux`
 
 `go get github.com/apexskier` I changed somethings in auth.go. Comment line 137-140. Other thing I can't remember.
 
Clone inside `github` in your `GOPATH`. Run `go run main.go` inside `github.com/flagz/src`.
